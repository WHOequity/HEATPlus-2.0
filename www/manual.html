<h3><a id="1. Introduction" name="1. Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>In the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) era, the world has committed to &ldquo;leave no-one behind.&rdquo; This requires a continuing focus on equity, reflected across multiple SDG goals and targets. Health inequality monitoring is critical to understand many aspects of who is being left behind (and where): it can identify differences in health indicators between different population subgroups. This is essential for the development of equity-oriented interventions, especially those on the path to universal health coverage, serving as the basis for the design and re-orientation of rights-based, gender-responsive and equitable health systems.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>

<h3><a id="1.1 What is HEAT Plus?" name="1.1 What is HEAT Plus?"></a>1.1 What is HEAT Plus?</h3>

<p>The Health Equity Assessment Toolkit Plus (HEAT Plus) is a software application that facilitates the assessment of within-country health inequalities. Users can upload their own data and assess inequalities at the national or subnational level (e.g. within a state or province) for a range of health indicators (e.g. antenatal care coverage or under-five mortality rate) and dimensions of inequality (e.g. age, sex or place of residence). Databases have to be in a specified format in order to be uploaded to HEAT Plus (please refer to section 2 of the user manual and the template for more information). Once uploaded, these data can be used to explore inequalities within a setting of choice and compare inequalities between different settings. Disaggregated data and 15 summary measures of inequality are presented in a variety of different ways, including customized tables and graphs. Results can be exported and saved in different formats.</p>

<p>The following two sections give a brief overview over what HEAT Plus can and cannot do (sections 1.2 and 1.3). Section 2 provides information on how to prepare for an assessment with HEAT Plus and section 3 on how to assess health inequalities in HEAT Plus. Section 4 answers Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). For more information about HEAT &ndash; the built-in database edition - please visit <a href="http://www.who.int/gho/health_equity/assessment_toolkit/en/" target="_blank">http://www.who.int/gho/health_equity/assessment_toolkit/en/</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="1.2 What HEAT Plus can do" name="1.2 What HEAT Plus can do"></a>1.2 What HEAT Plus can do</h3>

<ul>
	<li>HEAT Plus <strong>allows you to upload your own disaggregated data</strong> in a specified format (following the HEAT Plus template) in order to assess health inequalities using disaggregated data and summary measures of inequality. The process of carrying out health equity assessments using HEAT Plus is illustrated in figure 1 in the pdf version of the user manual, which can be accessed <a href="User_manual.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
	<li>HEAT Plus <strong>allows the assessment of data from a wide range of data sources</strong>. Population-based survey data may be used, such as data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) like they are used in HEAT, but HEAT Plus can also assess census data, Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) data, or administrative and health facility data.</li>
	<li>HEAT Plus <strong>allows you to assess inequalities in different settings</strong>. Inequalities can be assessed at the national level or at the subnational level (e.g. within a province or district).</li>
	<li>HEAT Plus <strong>allows you to choose what indicators will be assessed</strong>. You can assess indicators from within the health sector or beyond. For instance, HEAT Plus can be used to assess inequalities in reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health or non-communicable diseases. It can also be used to assess inequalities in health personnel or out-of-pocket expenditure. Beyond the realm of health, it can be used to look at indicators related to, for example, dropout from school among adolescent girls, access to safe drinking water, province-level voter turnout and a range of other health and development indicators of your choosing.</li>
	<li>HEAT Plus <strong>allows customised inequality dimensions to be assessed</strong>. You are free to choose any inequality dimension that distinguishes disadvantaged population subgroups and that is relevant to your specific research or programme context. Commonly used dimensions in health inequality monitoring include
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
		<li>Economic status</li>
		<li>Education</li>
		<li>Place of residence</li>
		<li>Sex</li>
		<li>Age</li>
		<li>Subnational region</li>
		<li>Country-specific or context-specific factors (e.g. occupation, district, caste).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="1.3 What HEAT Plus cannot do" name="1.3 What HEAT Plus cannot do"></a>1.3 What HEAT Plus cannot do</h3>

<ul>
	<li>HEAT Plus <strong>cannot improve the quality of data</strong>. For example, if you wish to assess data from multiple health facilities and data are missing, incomplete or inaccurate for some of those facilities, HEAT Plus cannot adjust or correct for this. In such a case, it is recommended that you turn attention to sourcing data with greater quality and completeness for the assessment .</li>
	<li>HEAT Plus <strong>cannot calculate disaggregated data from a raw dataset</strong>, i.e. it does not automatically generate estimates for population subgroups (defined by inequality dimensions, like age, sex and place of residence). To calculate disaggregated data, you must use statistical software packages, such as R, SAS, SPSS or Stata. Codes for calculating disaggregated data using household survey data are available at <a href="http://www.who.int/gho/health_equity/statistical_codes/en/" target="_blank">http://www.who.int/gho/health_equity/statistical_codes/en/</a>.</li>
	<li>HEAT Plus <strong>cannot calculate summary measures and their 95% confidence intervals if there are missing data</strong>. For example, complex measures of inequality can only be calculated if subgroup estimates are available for all population subgroups of a dimension. Moreover, for many complex measures, the size of the population in each subgroup is required. HEAT Plus will use this information to generate the population share for each subgroup and calculate weighted summary measures, i.e. summary measures that take into account the population share of each subgroup. Similarly, if standard errors of subgroup estimates are not included, HEAT Plus will not be able to generate 95% confidence intervals of summary measures either.</li>
	<li>HEAT Plus <strong>cannot calculate estimates for intersections of inequality dimensions</strong>, unless appropriately entered in the template. For example, if your template includes data disaggregated by sex and data disaggregated by economic status, HEAT Plus will not be able to calculate data that are simultaneously disaggregated by sex and economic status. If such an assessment is important to you, ensure that you enter data in your template accordingly. Please refer to question 14 in section 4 (FAQs) for more information.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="2.2 Preparing disaggregated data" name="2.2 Preparing disaggregated data"></a>2.2 Preparing disaggregated data</h3>

<p>HEAT Plus requires disaggregated data to be generated for population subgroups defined by inequality dimensions, using statistical software. Further information on how to generate disaggregated data using household survey data in R, SAS, SPSS and Stata is available at <a href="http://www.who.int/gho/health_equity/statistical_codes/en/" target="_blank">http://www.who.int/gho/health_equity/statistical_codes/en/</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>

<h3><a id="2.3 Preparing database for upload" name="2.3 Preparing database for upload"></a>2.3 Preparing database for upload</h3>

<p>HEAT Plus requires that disaggregated data be stored in a comma separated values (csv) or Microsoft Excel (xls or xlsx) file following the HEAT Plus template. The software recognises the variables and data in the template based on their placement and order. Certain variables are mandatory, while others are recommended or optional (see table 1).</p>

<p><strong>Mandatory variables</strong> are those without which data cannot be uploaded. These variables are: setting (which can be the name of a country, province, district, facility or other, as appropriate), year, source, indicator abbreviation, indicator name, dimension of inequality, population subgroup, subgroup estimate, specification of whether the indicator is favourable or not, indicator scale, specification of whether the dimension is ordered or not, subgroup order for ordered dimensions and reference subgroup for non-ordered dimensions.</p>

<p><strong>Recommended variables</strong> are required for the calculation of 95% confidence intervals of summary measures or for using certain functionalities in HEAT Plus. These include: standard errors of subgroup estimates, size of the population in each subgroup, the setting average (e.g. the national average for country-level data) and the ISO3 country code for country-level data (required for the benchmarking function).</p>

<p><strong>Optional variables</strong> include 95% confidence intervals (lower and upper bounds) of subgroup estimates and flag/notes.</p>

<h3><a id="2.4 Uploading database to HEAT Plus" name="2.4 Uploading database to HEAT Plus"></a>2.4 Uploading database to HEAT Plus</h3>

<p>Once you have prepared your database according to the HEAT Plus template, you can go on and upload your database to HEAT Plus. Section 3 provides further information on how to assess health inequalities in HEAT Plus.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>

<h3><a id="3. Assessing health inequalities in HEAT Plus" name="3. Assessing health inequalities in HEAT Plus"></a>3. Assessing health inequalities in HEAT Plus</h3>

<h3><a id="3.1 Home" name="3.1 Home"></a>3.1 Home</h3>

<p>The Home page provides an introduction to HEAT Plus. Here, you can choose to upload a new database or open an existing database, following the instructions below.</p>

<p>Once the database has been uploaded or opened successfully, you can go on to explore inequality in a selected setting of interest (<em>Explore Inequality</em> tab) and to compare the situation in a setting of interest with the situation in other settings (<em>Compare Inequality</em> tab). Please note that if neither a new or existing database is chosen, none of these tabs will be functional.
You can also choose to view the tool in another language: click on the language menu in the top right corner (English (EN) by default) and select your language of choice (French (FR), Portuguese (PT) or Spanish (ES)). Note that the tool will be translated into Arabic, Chinese and Russian in the future.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#Top" style="text-align: right;">Back to top</a></p>

<h4><a id="3.1.1 Uploading a new database" name="3.1.1 Uploading a new database"></a>3.1.1 Uploading a new database</h4>

<p>In order to upload a new database, choose the <strong>upload new database </strong>option on the homepage. You can then select the database using the <em>Browse</em> function and choose a database name. HEAT Plus uses the chosen database name to store the following five data files in the Software\HEATPlus\data\user-data folder on your machine:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>[database_name]_maindata.RDS</strong>, which contains the uploaded database of disaggregated data,</li>
	<li><strong>[database_name]_years.RDS</strong>, which contains information about all unique combinations of setting, year and source in the uploaded database,</li>
	<li><strong>[database_name]_strata.RDS</strong>, which contains information about all unique combinations of country, year, source, indicator and dimension in the uploaded database,</li>
	<li><strong>[database_name]_dimensions.RDS</strong>, which contains information about the dimensions in the uploaded database, including the dimension name, (maximum) number of categories and whether the dimension is ordered or not, and</li>
	<li><strong>[database_name]_inequals.RDS</strong>, which contains the summary measures of inequality, that have been calculated automatically based on the uploaded database.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that if the name already exists, HEAT Plus automatically replaces older databases with the latest one uploaded.</p>

<p>Following the selection of your database, you must click the <strong>upload database </strong>button. If the software loads correctly, summary measures will be calculated and a confirmation message will appear. This means that you may now go to the other tabs (<em>Explore Inequality </em>or <em>Compare Inequality)</em>.</p>

<p>If the software does not load correctly, you will be informed of what variables are missing or have to be corrected. You may then correct/revise the template and re-upload the database following the aforementioned procedure.</p>

<h3><a id="3.2 Explore Inequality" name="3.2 Explore Inequality"></a>3.2 Explore Inequality</h3>

<p>Under <strong>Explore Inequality</strong>, you can assess the situation within a setting of interest. Inequalities can be explored using disaggregated data in graphs (<em>Disaggregated data (graphs) </em>tab), detailed bar graphs (<em>Disaggregated data (detailed bar graph)</em> tab) and tables (<em>Disaggregated data (tables)</em> tab) as well as using summary measures of inequality in graphs (<em>Summary measures (graphs) </em>tab) and tables (<em>Summary measures (tables) </em>tab).</p>

<p>Note that multiple settings may not be viewed at the same time in the <em>Explore Inequality</em> tab. Benchmarking may be done, however, using the <em>Compare Inequality</em> tab.</p>

<p><strong>Tips for exploring inequality</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Whether looking at disaggregated data or summary measures in table or graph form, it is recommended to start exploring inequality by selecting one health indicator and one dimension of inequality at a time &ndash; rather than selecting multiple health indicators and multiple dimensions of inequality.</li>
	<li>It is not recommended to visualize favourable and adverse indicators together on one graph. The interpretation of these is different: for favourable indicators, a high value is desirable, while for adverse indicators, a low value is preferred.</li>
	<li>It is also not recommended to visualize indicators that are reported on different scales on one graph.</li>
	<li>When looking at multiple indicators together on one graph, it may be difficult to assess the situation correctly if there is a large difference in health levels between the indicators. For example, when looking at two health intervention indicators, one with high coverage and one with low coverage, they will both be visualized on the same scale covering a large range of values. This may make it difficult to discover smaller variations. In situations like this, it may be a good idea to look at each indicator individually before visualizing a number of indicators together on one graph.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>What you see</strong></div>

<p>The graph presents health data for population subgroups in a selected setting of interest. By default, a (horizontal) line graph is displayed showing subgroup estimates (on the x-axis) for each year (on the y-axis). Alternatively, a (vertical) bar graph can be displayed showing subgroup estimates (on the y-axis) for each year (on the x-axis). If more than one health indicator and dimension of inequality are selected at the same time, multiple graphs are shown &ndash; one for each indicator and dimension.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In line graphs, coloured shapes indicate population subgroups &ndash; each health indicator, dimension of inequality and year is represented on the graph by multiple coloured shapes (one for each subgroup). Black horizontal lines indicate the difference between minimum and maximum subgroup estimates.</p>

<p>In bar graphs, coloured bars indicate population subgroups &ndash; each health indicator, dimension of inequality and year is represented on the graph by multiple coloured bars (one for each subgroup). Numbers above bars indicate the respective subgroup estimates. 95% confidence intervals for each subgroup estimate can be displayed in the form of vertical lines (or whiskers).</p>

<p><strong>How to explore</strong></p>

<p>Hover over a shape or bar to see additional information about the data point, including about the setting, source, year, subgroup, population share of the subgroup, subgroup estimate, 95% confidence intervals of the subgroup estimate and setting average.</p>

<p><strong><a id="1. What is the minimum I have to enter in the HEAT Plus template?" name="1. What is the minimum I have to enter in the HEAT Plus template?"></a>1. What is the minimum I have to enter in the HEAT Plus template?</strong></p>

<p>In order to upload data to HEAT Plus, you must include information on mandatory variables. Mandatory variables include: setting, year, source, indicator_abbreviation, indicator_name, dimension, subgroup, estimate, favourable_indicator, indicator_scale, ordered_dimension, subgroup_order and reference_subgroup. Please refer to section 2.3 of the user manual or to the template for a detailed explanation of these variables.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a id="2. What types of data sources can I use in HEAT Plus?" name="2. What types of data sources can I use in HEAT Plus?"></a>2. What types of data sources can I use in HEAT Plus?</strong></p>

<p>Various types of data sources may be used (separately or jointly) in HEAT Plus. Population-based survey data may be used, such as data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) like they are used in HEAT, but HEAT Plus can also assess census data, Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) data or administrative and health facility data .&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a id="3. Can I combine multiple data sources in one HEAT Plus dataset?" name="3. Can I combine multiple data sources in one HEAT Plus dataset?"></a>3. Can I combine multiple data sources in one HEAT Plus dataset?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. Data from multiple sources may be combined in one dataset. For example, in your template of disaggregated data, you can have data on immunization coverage disaggregated by district from health facilities and data on immunization coverage disaggregated by economic status from household surveys.</p>

<p><strong><a id="4. Can I carry out assessments in different settings / at different levels?" name="4. Can I carry out assessments in different settings / at different levels?"></a>4. Can I carry out assessments in different settings / at different levels?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. HEAT Plus allows you to assess inequalities in different settings. Inequalities can be assessed at the national level or at the subnational level (e.g. within a province or district), provided disaggregated data for the level of interest are available and uploaded correctly.</p>

<p><strong><a id="5. Can I include indicators not related to health?" name="5. Can I include indicators not related to health?"></a>5. Can I include indicators not related to health?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. You can upload any indicator disaggregated by any dimension of inequality as long as your database complies with the template specifications. For instance, HEAT Plus can be used to assess inequalities in reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health or non-communicable diseases. It can also be used to assess inequalities in health personnel or out-of-pocket expenditure. Beyond the realm of health, it can be used to look at indicators related to, for example, dropout from school among adolescent girls, or access to safe drinking water, province-level voter turnout, and a range of other health and development indicators of your choosing. For example, beyond the realm of health, HEAT Plus could be used to look at dropout from school among adolescent girls access to safe drinking water or any other health or development indicator of your choosing.</p>

<p><strong><a id="6. Can I include indicators with different units?" name="6. Can I include indicators with different units?"></a>6. Can I include indicators with different units?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. You can upload indicators with different units, provided you enter the correct indicator scale for each indicator in the template. For example, for total fertility rate, which is usually reported as the number of children per woman, the indicator scale would be 1, while for coverage of skilled birth attendance, which is reported as a percentage, the indicator scale would be 100, and for neonatal mortality rate, which is reported as the number of deaths per 1000 live births, the indicator scale would be 1000.</p>

<p><strong><a id="7. What is meant by &quot;affected population&quot;?" name="7. What is meant by &quot;affected population&quot;?"></a>7. What is meant by &quot;affected population&quot;?</strong></p>

<p>Affected population refers to the number of individuals at risk or affected within a population subgroup (defined by inequality dimension, e.g. quintile of economic status).</p>

<p>It basically represents the denominator of an indicator in each population subgroup. Providing this information allows HEAT Plus to take account of the proportion of the population represented in that population subgroup for certain summary measures (like Slope Index of Inequality).</p>

<p>For example, for births attended by skilled health personnel disaggregated by economic status, the affected population is the number of live births in each economic status quintile or subgroup. For household survey data, this variable can easily be calculated in R, SAS, SPSS, or Stata using statistical codes available at <a href="http://www.who.int/gho/health_equity/statistical_codes/en/" target="_blank">http://www.who.int/gho/health_equity/statistical_codes/en/</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a id="8. Do I have to enter an ISO3 country code?" name="8. Do I have to enter an ISO3 country code?"></a>8. Do I have to enter an ISO3 country code?</strong></p>

<p>It is recommended that you enter an ISO3 country code for country-level data. Entering an ISO3 code will activate the benchmark options in the Compare Inequality tab. Based on the ISO3 code, HEAT Plus will recognize the World Bank income group and WHO Region of the countries in your dataset (as long as your country is one of the 194 WHO Member States). In HEAT Plus you can use this information and filter countries by World Bank income group and WHO Region and thus select your benchmark countries. Please refer to supplementary table 1 in the pdf version of the user manual (available <a href="User_manual.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>) for a list of WHO member states and corresponding ISO3 country codes (as well as corresponding WHO regions and country income groups).</p>

<p><strong><a id="9. How do I correctly enter information for the variable &quot;favourable_indicator&quot; in the template?" name="9. How do I correctly enter information for the variable &quot;favourable_indicator&quot; in the template?"></a>9. How do I correctly enter information for the variable &quot;favourable_indicator&quot; in the template?</strong></p>

<p>The variable &ldquo;favourable_indicators&rdquo; indicates the indicator type. It must be 1 for favourable indicators and 0 for non-favourable (adverse) indicators.</p>

<p><em>Favourable indicators</em> measure desirable health events that are public health action promotes. They include health intervention indicators, such as antenatal care coverage, and desirable health outcome indicators, such as life expectancy. For these indicators, the ultimate goal is to achieve a maximum level, either in health intervention coverage or health outcome (e.g. complete coverage of antenatal care or the highest possible life expectancy).</p>

<p><em>Adverse indicators</em> measure undesirable health events that are to be reduced or eliminated through public health action. They include undesirable health outcome indicators, such as stunting prevalence in children aged less than five years or under-five mortality rate. Here, the ultimate goal is to achieve a minimum level (e.g. theoretically 0 deaths per 1000 live births).</p>

<p><strong><a id="10. How do I correctly enter information for the variable &quot;indicator_scale&quot; in the template?" name="10. How do I correctly enter information for the variable &quot;indicator_scale&quot; in the template?"></a>10. How do I correctly enter information for the variable &quot;indicator_scale&quot; in the template?</strong></p>

<p>The variable &ldquo;indicator_scale&rdquo; indicates the scale of the indicator, such as &quot;100&quot; for indicators reported as percentages or &quot;1000&quot; for indicators reported as rates per 1000 population.</p>

<p><strong><a id="11. How do I correctly enter information for the variable &quot;ordered_dimension&quot; in the template?" name="11. How do I correctly enter information for the variable &quot;ordered_dimension&quot; in the template?"></a>11. How do I correctly enter information for the variable &quot;ordered_dimension&quot; in the template?</strong></p>

<p>This dummy variable indicates the dimension type. It must be 0 for dimensions with two subgroups (binary dimensions). For dimensions with more than two subgroups, it must be 1 for ordered dimensions and 0 for non-ordered dimensions.</p>

<p><em>Binary dimensions</em> compare the situation in two population subgroups (e.g. males and females).</p>

<p><em>Ordered dimensions</em> have (more than two) ordered subgroups that have an inherent positioning and can be ranked. For example, education has an inherent ordering in the sense that those with less education unequivocally have less of something compared to those with more education.</p>

<p><em>Non-ordered dimensions</em> have (more than two) non-ordered subgroups that are not based on criteria that can be logically ranked. Subnational regions are an example of non-ordered groupings.</p>

<p><strong><a id="12. How do I correctly enter information for the variable &quot;subgroup_order&quot; in the template?" name="12. How do I correctly enter information for the variable &quot;subgroup_order&quot; in the template?"></a>12. How do I correctly enter information for the variable &quot;subgroup_order&quot; in the template?</strong></p>

<p>The variable &ldquo;subgroup_order&rdquo; indicates the order of subgroups for ordered dimensions.</p>

<p><em>For ordered dimensions</em> (i.e. if ordered_dimension=1), this variable must be an increasing sequence of integers starting with the value 1 for the most-disadvantaged subgroup. For example, for education with three subgroups, the most-disadvantaged subgroup &quot;No education&quot; will be assigned the value 1, &quot;Primary school&quot; will be assigned the value 2 and the most-advantaged subgroup &quot;Secondary school +&quot; will be assigned the value 3.</p>

<p><em>For non-ordered dimensions</em> and <em>binary dimensions</em> (i.e. if ordered_dimension=0), this variable must be 0.</p>

<p><strong><a id="13. How do I correctly enter information for the variable &quot;reference_subgroup&quot; in the template?" name="13. How do I correctly enter information for the variable &quot;reference_subgroup&quot; in the template?"></a>13. How do I correctly enter information for the variable &quot;reference_subgroup&quot; in the template?</strong></p>

<p>The variable &ldquo;reference_subgroup&rdquo; indicates the reference subgroup for non-ordered dimensions and binary dimensions.</p>

<p><em>For ordered dimensions</em> (i.e. if ordered_dimension=1), this variable must be 0.</p>

<p><em>For non-ordered dimensions</em> and <em>binary dimensions</em> (i.e. if ordered_dimension=0), you have the option to choose a reference subgroup. A reference subgroup can be chosen by assigning the value 1 to that subgroup and 0 to all other subgroups. For example, for subnational regions (with more than two subgroups), the capital city can be chosen as the reference subgroup. For place of residence (urban vs. rural), urban can be chosen as the reference subgroup.</p>

<p><strong><a id="14. Can I look at double disaggregation or intersections of inequality dimensions?" name="14. Can I look at double disaggregation or intersections of inequality dimensions?"></a>14. Can I look at double disaggregation or intersections of inequality dimensions?</strong></p>

<p>If you wish to look at intersections of inequality dimensions (like sex-economic status), the data will have to be entered in the template for these separate subgroups. If the data is entered by single inequality dimensions, HEAT Plus cannot automatically look at intersections of inequality dimensions.</p>

<p><strong><a id="15. Can I look at both the average and the level of inequality according to a selected dimension at the same time?" name="15. Can I look at both the average and the level of inequality according to a selected dimension at the same time?"></a>15. Can I look at both the average and the level of inequality according to a selected dimension at the same time?</strong></p>
